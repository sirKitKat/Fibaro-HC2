Through the API of a HC2, new scenes could be added and changes to excisting scenes could be made.
This clould result in the HC2 pulling general functions and code from a central place like GitHub.
updating code could be one of the posibilities !

Update 2018-04-11:
  Succesfully tested and this works. I'll try to optimize the code further and make it more dummy proof.
  Extra task will be to pull code from github instead of other scenes
